      "Description": "Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).

Twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica.",

In our culture there are so many myths about owls. When an owl is singing people believe that someone will die. We have many owls in our neigbourhood. We even have a nest here. At night owls create a lot of noise. I hear them even when I sleep. I see them flying. They are big. Do you like owls?",
